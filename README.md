# Real-Time Location Tracking App

This project is a real-time location tracking web application using **Node.js**, **Socket.io**, and **Leaflet.js**. It allows users to share their current location and see the route to a specified destination (Point B). The app displays the user's location on a map and provides routing functionality from the user's real-time location (Point A) to a search input destination (Point B).

## Features

- **Real-time Location Tracking**: Automatically track the user's real-time location using the browser's Geolocation API.
- **Interactive Map**: Displays the user's location on a map using Leaflet.js.
- **Searchable Destination**: Allows users to search for a destination (Point B) and displays the route from the user's current location (Point A) to Point B.
- **Responsive Design**: The app works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Leaflet.js for maps, Socket.io for real-time updates)
- **Map Service**: Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap tiles
- **Routing**: Leaflet Routing Machine
